Stage 4b: Minimizing Screen Plotting
In the first version of your renderer (call it “stage 4a”), it is acceptable to plot an entire frame each time 
the master render routine is invoked. Later, an easy way to animate the game (in stage 5) is to clear the 
screen and then completely re-render the entire model, for each frame. Of course, the disadvantage of this 
approach is that it is slow. It is therefore difficult to achieve, smooth, high-quality graphics with a high 
frame rate. 
Once stage 4a is working, you may wish to consider improving the renderer so that it only re-plots the
aspects of the model that have changed since a previous invocation. There is more than one way to 
accomplish this – working out the details is your responsibility. 
Completing stage 4b is not mandatory before starting stage 5. However, it is strongly recommended that 
you start thinking about how to do it. By the end of stage 6, it is likely that your game’s graphics will 
suffer very noticeably if it naively and inefficiently over-plots.
