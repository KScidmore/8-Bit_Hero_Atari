- Key:
    <> this will be some sort of variable 

- Note Object Access:
    - instead of:
        model->notes.<attribute>
    - it is this now:
        model->lanes[<index>].notes[<index>].<attribute>
    - notes:
        - FRET_POS fret and UINT8 index are new function arguments 
        - every events function has been changed 
        - any model functions that use lanes or notes are likely changed
