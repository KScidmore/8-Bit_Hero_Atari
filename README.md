# 8-Bit-Hero
Will be stating info useful to us here.

- using Allman bracing style
- documentation templates exist in ./personal-docs/
- apparently you can add PDFs to github, so I added Paul's revisions and our latest copy of the document to ./stage-1/
	- whenever we update the document we should re-upload a copy here
	- apparently .docx files can act weird so I just left that out
- tracking tasks we need to complete in the issues tab
	- labelling by implementation/documentation and stage so we can sort it easy
 	- have the ability to assign tasks from there also
- VS Code extensions that might be useful:
	- 68k Counter by gigabates
 	- github pull requests by github
 	- motorola 68000 assembly extension by clc_xce
