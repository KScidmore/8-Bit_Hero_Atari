# 8-Bit-Hero
Will be stating info useful to us here.

- using Allman bracing style
- documentation templates exist in ./personal-docs/
- apparently you can add PDFs to github, so I added Paul's revisions and our latest copy of the document to ./stage-1/
	- whenever we update the document we should re-upload a copy here
	- apparently .docx files can act weird so I just left that out
