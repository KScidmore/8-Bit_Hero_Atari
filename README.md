# 8-Bit-Hero
Will be stating info useful to us here.

- using Allman bracing style
- documentation templates exist in ./personal-docs/
- apparently you can add PDFs to github, so I added Paul's revisions and our latest copy of the document to ./stage-1/
	- whenever we update the document we should re-upload a copy here
	- apparently .docx files can act weird so I just left that out
- tracking tasks we need to complete in the issues tab
	- labelling by implementation/documentation and stage so we can sort it easy
 	- have the ability to assign tasks from there also
	- we should chat about this shit, I think it might be useful if we track tasks here; if we want to start working on something, assign yourself the task if we haven't already split things up, if it doesn't exist on the board yet post it; if you want to start working on something check the issues tab first; maybe something like that, we can discuss it; would solve that issue where we don't know if the other is working on something unless there is an existing branch and even then we don't really know whats going on 
- VS Code extensions that might be useful:
	- 68k Counter by gigabates
 	- github pull requests by github
 	- motorola 68000 assembly extension by clc_xce
