Hi Paul, we will be noting any information that you should know in this document
such as glitches or issues we're facing that will affect you.

- we are saving our code in stages to preserve our previous work 
    - we've only changed errors or unintentional mistakes 
- we've needed to constantly go back and fix model issues that hadn't previously 
  resolved, so the later stages will have more correct implementations, and the 
  earlier stages may have errors / be completely broken 
- stage-4a old and tst_rend are just to keep us organized, they aren't hosting 
  any finalized or very useful stuff
